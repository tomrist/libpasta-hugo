The following examples are for the core library written in Rust. See [other languages](../../other-languages/)
for language bindings and examples. Where possible, the APIs exported by libpasta are
identical to those used in the Rust library.

### Password Hashes

A common scenario is that a particular user has password, which a service will check on each login to authenticate the user.

```rust
extern crate libpasta;

// We re-export the rpassword crate for CLI password input.
use libpasta::rpassword::*;

fn main() {
    println!("Please enter your password:");
    let password = read_password().unwrap();
    let password_hash = libpasta::hash_password(password);
    println!("The hashed password is: '{}'", password_hash);
}

```

The above code randomly generates a seed, and outputs the hash in the following format:
`$$argon2i$m=4096,t=3,p=1$P7ckzVebJQZCacmRdOdd1g$NNPTr2du3PQbGWUQF9+ZzAaIZKA/FlwJRR+TQ/h0Pq8`.

Details for how this is serialized can be found in the [technical details chapter](../../technical-details/phc-string-format/). This adheres to libpasta's [strong defaults](../what-is-libpasta#secure-by-default) principle. 

#### Verifying passwords

Now that you have the hashed output, verifying that an inputted password is correct can be done as follows:


```rust
extern crate libpasta;

// We re-export the rpassword crate for CLI password input.
use libpasta::rpassword::*;

const PASSWORD_HASH: &'static str = "$$argon2i$m=4096,t=3,p=1$P7ckzVebJQZCacmRdOdd1g$NNPTr2du3PQbGWUQF9+ZzAaIZKA/FlwJRR+TQ/h0Pq8";

fn main() {
    println!("Please re-enter your password:");
    let password = read_password().unwrap();
    let is_correct = libpasta::verify_password(PASSWORD_HASH, password);
    if is_correct {
        println!("The inputted password is correct!");
    } else {
        println!("Incorrect password.");
    }
}

```

#### Password migration

One of the key features of `libpasta` is the ability to easily migrate passwords
to new algorithms.

Suppose we previously have bcrypt hashes in the following form:
`$2a$10$175ikf/E6E.73e83.fJRbODnYWBwmfS0ENdzUBZbedUNGO.99wJfa`.
This a bcrypt hash, structured as `$<bcrypt identifier>$<cost>$<salthash>`.

We have two options for migrating passwords:
1. Wrap the existing algorithm in the new algorithm (effectively two hashes).
2. Wait for the user to login and update algorithm.

The two options can be seen in the following code:

```rust
extern crate libpasta;

// We re-export the rpassword crate for CLI password input.
use libpasta::rpassword::*;

const OLD_PASSWORD_HASH: &'static str = "$2a$10$LhQ7vr/pnBdDprTRX7JaJesx.qd7qAYdJryEt5z2VM7EUsbNNnoIi";

fn main() {
    // Option 1. Migrate by wrapping
    let mut hash = OLD_PASSWORD_HASH.to_string();
    libpasta::migrate_hash(&mut hash);
    println!("Migrated. New hash: \n{}\n", hash);
    // Outputs:
    // $!$argon2i$m=4096,t=3,p=1$$2y-mcf$cost=10$NjS9xtBrpDfFrtVTZ9LcLg$ull3Vk89hE7vkrX5FJ4zM4foaCJP61EBuaxJMOVuLDw

    // Option 2. Update on password entry
    let mut hash = OLD_PASSWORD_HASH.to_string();
    println!("Please enter your password:");
    let password = read_password().unwrap();
    if libpasta::verify_password_update_hash(&mut hash, password) {
        println!("Password correct, new hash: \n{}", hash);
        // Outputs:
        // $2a$10$LhQ7vr/pnBdDprTRX7JaJesx.qd7qAYdJryEt5z2VM7EUsbNNnoIi
    } else {
        println!("Password incorrect, hash unchanged: \n{}", hash);
        // Outputs:
        // $$argon2i$m=4096,t=3,p=1$hd2k5vRVJMK1aimiWP4moQ$NIN4COvpn4oEkirg+eeJ7/Vp5YbAXG+3sUVXHc/ttWg
    }
}
```

In the first option, we do not need the user's password (and can therefore
migrate all passwords whenever necessary). However, the password hash is now
comprised of both a bcrypt computation AND an argon2 computation. Notice the
`libpasta`-specific password hash, `$!` denoting a nested hash value.

In the second option, if the user correctly enters their password, then the hash
is recomputed from scratch with a fresh salt. However, until the user logs in, 
the password hash will never be updated and is potentially vulnerable.

The best option in practice is to combine the two: migrate all password hashes
using the first option as soon as possible, and then opportunistically recompute
the new hash whenever the user logs in.

#### Basic configuration

`libpasta` supports runtime configuration by using config files, either 
found in default directories or specified by environment variables.

Accepted formats are YAML and TOML. An example config files looks like:

```yaml
algorithm:
  scrypt-mcf:
    log_n: 16
    r: 8
    p: 1

force-migration: true
```

This specifies the algorithm to use, in this case, scrypt.

By default, `libpasta` will search the current directory for a file with the name
`.libpasta.{yaml,toml}`. Alternatively, a specific (relative or absolute) path
can be supplied by running: `LIBPASTA_CFG=path/to/file.yaml <app-name>`.
